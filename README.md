# Snek - a hacky ORM library for Python 3
![Bla](https://i.imgur.com/hlJGRT0.jpg)

Built by me and @kitzin

### Features
 - Supports different languages through use of "processors" that translate common operations into selected SQL flavor.
 - Create all/drop all approach to tables. Screw migrations. (Our course preaches "DO IT RIGHT FIRST" approach, so we'll abide)
 - Basic CRUD for Models, some extended support for Select's
 - Relations might come.
 - Ugly use of Python 3 builtins module to pass DB connection from main class to models.
